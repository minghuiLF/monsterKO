What we have implemented is a servive that can predict property price based on the client's inputs with these features: 
Suburb, Property Type, year built, # Bedroom, # Bathroom, # Kitchen, Garage Capacity, Price Range.

Price range is the a number of client can accept the range of SalePrice of recommend list based on the predict price

These features are what we think a client may most cares about when he search a property price.

Here comes a scenario. As a client, I want to look at a specific suburb and the other features as the constraints, and the predicted price.
I input the 7 features I want, and the floating range I can accept. Then I can get the Predicted price for me between this range, then 
followed with the bottom 10 Price properties details, the maximum price property details, the median price property details and
the minimum price property details.

If I want to get an overall view of each feature, I click on the more information button, get to another page. It shows 4 pie charts
represent proportion in that price range for Bedroom number, Bathroom number, Kitchen number, Garage Capacity respectively. And a barchart
shows the number of properties built in each year.
